# Overview

## Executive Summary

Our platform is a comprehensive production management solution designed specifically for commercial, fashion, and music video audiovisual productions. It streamlines the complex logistics of these high-intensity productions by managing people, schedules, and locations while automatically generating all necessary documentation to keep teams informed and coordinated.

The platform addresses the critical challenge of production coordination by centralizing information and automating documentation workflows, enabling producers to focus on creative execution rather than administrative overhead.

## Current Product Capabilities

### Platform Architecture

The platform is built on three foundational pillars that enable comprehensive data cross-referencing and dashboard creation:

- **People (Who)**: Comprehensive management of all production stakeholders
- **Events (What)**: Timeline management of all production activities
- **Locations (Where)**: Geographic coordination of shooting and logistics sites
This architecture creates a unified timeline of all activities that comprise an audiovisual production, currently focused on the production phase (shooting), with future expansion planned for pre-production and post-production phases.

### Platform Structure

The application is organized around project-based navigation, with all production management tools nested within individual projects:

**Project Management:**

- `/projects`
- `/projects/{projectName}`
**Organizational Structure:**

- `/departments`
**Core Management Pages (within each project):**

- `/projects/{projectName}/people` (with drawer navigation: `#person-name-tab`)
- `/projects/{projectName}/people/add` (dedicated add person page)
- `/projects/{projectName}/events`
- `/projects/{projectName}/events/add` (dedicated add event page)
- `/projects/{projectName}/locations`
- `/projects/{projectName}/locations/add` (dedicated add location page)
**Document Generation (within each project):**
