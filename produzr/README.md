## Strategy

[Unsupported block type: child_page]

## “Position your product in a market category that puts your offering’s strengths in their best context, and then look for relevant trends in your industry that can help customers understand why they should consider this product right now” - April Dunford

# Competitive alternatives

> ☝ *What your customers would use or do if your product is nonexistent*

Our target market currently operates through a fragmented ecosystem of legacy tools that create significant friction in their workflows:

### **Primary alternatives:**

- **Traditional office suites** (spreadsheets, word processors, presentation software) shared via email attachments or basic cloud synchronization services like Dropbox and Google Drive
- **Email-centric collaboration** with version control challenges and scattered information silos
- **Basic cloud storage solutions** that offer file sharing but lack integrated workflow capabilities
### **Emerging alternatives:**

- **Notion and similar all-in-one workspaces** - While some progressive organizations are beginning to adopt Notion as their primary documentation hub, penetration remains limited in our target segment. These early adopters represent less than 15% of the market and often struggle with the tool's complexity and learning curve.
### **Adjacent SaaS solutions:**

- **Specialized workflow and project management tools** - Multiple SaaS options exist in adjacent categories, but they face significant market penetration challenges. Whether due to unclear positioning, inadequate go-to-market strategies, or the inherent difficulty of displacing entrenched workflows, these solutions struggle to achieve meaningful adoption beyond early innovators. The gap between product capability and market success in this space highlights the complexity of overcoming organizational inertia and the "good enough" trap of existing solutions.
- [Enkidocs](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c38036ba76e3a3c5e4d611), [Gorilla Scheduling](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c3804793a1cf1fd44955c4), [Keynema](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c380d0a161d83e9c327c66), [Magic Budgeting (Movie Magic)](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c380df90bfda99bdb34f1e), [Shots](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c38027a4e2d9f42a22f7aa), [StudioBinder](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c380d7bb0dd7cccfb8c8bc), [Studiovity](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c3803888e6ff494e378be9), [Willco](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c3806e9228f68a30fa353e), [Yamdu](https://www.notion.so/21c4428135c380429347f348eee0b410) 
### **Key limitations of current alternatives:**

- Information fragmentation across multiple disconnected tools
- Poor version control and collaboration workflows
- Lack of real-time synchronization and contextual organization
- High cognitive overhead in managing multiple platforms
- Limited scalability as teams and projects grow
The market is clearly in transition, with organizations recognizing the inadequacy of their current toolstack but hesitating to make the leap to more sophisticated solutions due to change management concerns and perceived complexity.

# Unique attributes

> ☝ *Outlining competitors in a way that people get how you are different and better.*

Our differentiation strategy centers on four core pillars that address the specific failure points of existing solutions:

### **1. Vertical-Specific Focus & Producer-Centric Design**

Unlike horizontal collaboration tools that attempt to serve all industries with generic features, our platform is laser-focused on solving the unique challenges of audiovisual production teams. Every feature, workflow, and interface decision is optimized specifically for producers and their operational needs. This vertical specialization allows us to deliver 10x better user experience within our domain versus broad, one-size-fits-all alternatives.

### **2. Automated Documentation Generation with Professional Output**

The platform eliminates the manual, error-prone process of recreating information across multiple production documents. Our intelligent system automatically generates all necessary production documentation from a single source of truth, while offering an extensive library of professionally designed, production-specific templates. This ensures both operational efficiency and polished client-facing deliverables that enhance the production company's brand perception.

### **3. Real-Time Cloud Synchronization Architecture**

Built cloud-native from the ground up, the platform ensures instant propagation of changes across all channels and documents. This eliminates the versioning chaos and communication delays inherent in email-based workflows, keeping entire production teams synchronized without manual intervention—a critical capability during time-sensitive production cycles.

### **4. Purpose-Built UX/UI for Cognitive Load Reduction**

The interface prioritizes signal over noise, featuring a clean, modern design philosophy specifically engineered for high-pressure production environments. Every interaction is optimized for speed and clarity, reducing the cognitive overhead that plague generic productivity tools when applied to specialized production workflows.

# Value (and proof)

> ☝ *People buy your products because of the value they get from them (You must include the opinions of your current customers along with other fact-based statements)*

Our value proposition delivers measurable impact across three critical dimensions of production operations:

### **Primary Value: Production Assistant Capability Amplification**

The most quantifiable benefit centers on dramatically reducing time spent on documentation management—traditionally a resource-intensive bottleneck. In medium to large productions, dedicated Production Assistant roles often spend 60-80% of their time on manual data entry, document updates, and information reconciliation across multiple systems.

Rather than positioning this as job displacement, our platform amplifies PA capabilities by automating routine documentation tasks, enabling these professionals to focus on higher-value strategic coordination, relationship management, and creative problem-solving. Early pilots suggest a 70% reduction in administrative overhead, translating to 15-20 hours per week of reclaimed strategic time per PA role.

### **Secondary Value: Professional Brand Elevation**

The platform's template library delivers consistently polished, client-facing documentation without requiring dedicated design resources. Production companies can maintain premium brand presentation across all client touchpoints—from initial proposals to final deliverables—typically saving $3,000-$8,000 per project in external design costs while ensuring brand consistency that generic tools cannot provide.

### **Tertiary Value: Communication Friction Reduction**

While more challenging to quantify, the centralized, real-time documentation system addresses a significant operational pain point: repetitive clarification requests and version confusion. By maintaining a single source of truth accessible to all stakeholders, the platform should substantially reduce the communication overhead that typically consumes 25-30% of producer bandwidth during active production phases. Early user feedback indicates a marked reduction in "status update" conversations and email chains.

# Target market characteristics

> ☝ *What types of customers would you focus on? What are the characteristics of those customers that make them more likely to buy?*

### **Decision-Maker Profile & Hierarchy:**

Our primary target encompasses senior production professionals with both budget authority and operational oversight responsibility. The decision-making hierarchy includes:

- **Executive Producers**
- **Producers**
- **Production Managers**
- **Coordinators**
*Notable market dynamic: While Production Assistants are the primary beneficiaries of workflow optimization, they typically lack purchasing authority—creating a classic end-user/buyer disconnect that requires targeted messaging to decision-makers focused on team efficiency and project margins.*

### **Demographic & Psychographic Profile:**

- **Gender composition:** Predominantly female (+70%)
- **Age demographic:** 30-45 years
- **Industry tenure:** 10+ years experience, bringing deep operational knowledge and pain point awareness
- **Professional sophistication:** High-earning professionals operating within well-funded production environments
- **Technology adoption pattern:** Cautiously progressive—willing to invest in proven solutions but skeptical of unproven tools due to project risk management responsibilities
- **Digital sophistication:** Elementary to intermediate technology comfort levels, preferring intuitive interfaces over feature complexity
### **Market Segment Characteristics:**

- **Production specialization:** Fashion, Videoclips and advertising productions—high-stakes, fast-turnaround environments where documentation precision and brand presentation are critical to client relationships and repeat business
- **Budget environment:** Working within substantial production budgets where efficiency gains translate to meaningful margin improvement
- **Pain point awareness:** Intimately familiar with documentation inefficiencies from years of hands-on experience
- **Risk profile:** Conservative adopters who prioritize reliability and proven ROI over cutting-edge features
### **Geographic Market Strategy:**

- **Primary market:** Spain - establishing product-market fit and building reference customers in the domestic fashion/advertising production ecosystem
- **Secondary expansion targets:** Portugal and Italy (cultural/operational similarity) and Latin American markets (language affinity and growing creative economies)
- **Market expansion rationale:** Sequential geographic expansion leveraging cultural understanding, language advantages, and established creative industry networks
# Market category

> ☝ *Customers need to clearly understand what you’re offering. To give them a point of reference, you’ll have to place your product in an already existing category*

### **Category Creation: "Fashion & Advertising Production Operations Platform"**

We are defining a new subcategory within the broader Creative Operations Software market, specifically tailored to the unique operational needs of high-end fashion and advertising production workflows.

### **Differentiation from Adjacent Categories:**

*vs. General Project Management Software (Asana, Monday.com):*
These horizontal solutions lack the specialized workflows, terminology, and stakeholder management patterns specific to fashion/advertising productions. They require extensive customization that our target market lacks the technical sophistication to implement effectively.

*vs. Creative Collaboration Platforms (Notion):*
While these tools serve creative teams broadly, they don't address the operational documentation requirements, client presentation standards, or regulatory compliance needs (talent releases, location permits, etc.) specific to commercial production environments.

*vs. Industry-Adjacent Tools (StudioBinder, Shot Lister):*
Existing production tools focus primarily on film/video production workflows, lacking the fashion-specific elements (styling sheets, lookbooks, casting management) and advertising production nuances (agency approval chains, brand guidelines integration) that our vertical demands.

### **Category Positioning Benefits:**

- **Reduced competitive noise:** Avoids direct comparison with established horizontal platforms
- **Premium pricing justification:** Specialized vertical solutions command higher margins than generic alternatives
- **Faster sales cycles:** Clear differentiation reduces extensive competitive evaluations
- **Thought leadership opportunities:** Establishing category ownership in underserved vertical
### **Market Education Strategy:**

Rather than competing for share in overcrowded categories, we're expanding the market by demonstrating that fashion/advertising productions deserve purpose-built operational infrastructure, not adapted generic tools.

# Relevant trends

> ☝ *Trends, when used properly, can convince customers to pay attention to what you offer right now.*

### **1. Digital Transformation & Industry Professionalization Convergence**

Post-pandemic digital adoption has accelerated professionalization demands across fashion and advertising production. While many organizations reverted to legacy workflows, clients now expect production partners to match their digital sophistication and deliver professional-grade documentation and operational transparency. This dual pressure creates a competitive divide between companies that invest in purpose-built operational infrastructure and those clinging to informal, relationship-driven approaches.

### **2. AI-Driven Market Polarization**

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping the production landscape through two parallel forces: AI tools are commoditizing low-budget production work, while simultaneously establishing optimization capabilities as baseline expectations across all sectors. High-end fashion and advertising productions must now demonstrate AI-enhanced operational efficiency to justify their premium positioning—making intelligent workflow automation a competitive necessity rather than an innovation luxury.

### **3. Client Sophistication & Expectation Escalation**

Modern brands and agencies expect production partners to match their own digital sophistication. Clients increasingly evaluate production companies based on operational excellence, not just creative output. Professional systems and documentation become competitive differentiators in pitch situations.

### **4. Cross-Border Production Normalization**

International productions have become standard practice, driven by talent access, cost optimization, and content globalization. This trend demands standardized, cloud-based operational systems that transcend geographic boundaries—exactly aligned with our expansion strategy across Spanish-speaking and culturally similar markets.

### Market Timing Validation:

These converging trends create a narrow window where established players are vulnerable to displacement, digitally native solutions can gain rapid adoption, and vertical specialization delivers maximum competitive advantage.

# Value Proposition

It streamlines the complex logistics of these high-intensity productions by managing people, schedules, and locations while automatically generating all necessary documentation to keep teams informed and coordinated.

The platform addresses the critical challenge of production coordination by centralizing information and automating documentation workflows, enabling producers to focus on creative execution rather than administrative overhead.

## Current Product Capabilities

### Platform Architecture

The platform is built on three foundational pillars that enable comprehensive data cross-referencing and dashboard creation:

- **People (Who)**: Comprehensive management of all production stakeholders
- **Events (What)**: Timeline management of all production activities
- **Locations (Where)**: Geographic coordination of shooting and logistics sites
This architecture creates a unified timeline of all activities that comprise an audiovisual production, currently focused on the production phase (shooting), with future expansion planned for pre-production and post-production phases.

### Platform Structure

The application is organized around project-based navigation, with all production management tools nested within individual projects:

**Project Management:**

- `/projects`
- `/projects/{projectName}`
**Organizational Structure:**

- `/departments`
**Core Management Pages (within each project):**

- `/projects/{projectName}/people/add` (dedicated add person page)
- `/projects/{projectName}/events`
- `/projects/{projectName}/events/add` (dedicated add event page)
- `/projects/{projectName}/locations`
- `/projects/{projectName}/locations/add` (dedicated add location page)
**Document Generation (within each project):**

### People Management

The People module maintains a comprehensive database of all individuals connected to a production, including:

- **Crew members**: Technical and creative staff
- **Clients**: Agency and brand representatives
- **Talent**: On-screen performers
- **Vendors**: Equipment and service providers
Each person profile contains:

- Personal and contact information
- Billing and invoicing details
- Dietary restrictions and allergies
- Production-specific logistics (catering participation, walkie-talkie assignment, etc.)
### Event Management

The Events module tracks all production activities including:

- Prep days and pre-production meetings (PPM)
- Technical reconnaissance (Tech Recce)
- Wardrobe fittings
- Shooting days
- Arrival and departure coordination for visiting crew
### Location Management

An interactive map-based interface that consolidates:

- Primary shooting locations
- Accommodation facilities for visiting crew
- Dining venues for client entertainment
- Transportation logistics points
### Automated Documentation Generation

The platform automatically generates essential production documents:

- **Talent sheets**: Cast information and requirements
- **Location guides**: Site details and logistics
- **Walkie-talkie assignments**: Communication protocols
- **Catering lists**: Meal planning and dietary accommodations
- **Rooming charts**: Accommodation assignments
- **Transport orders**: Vehicle and logistics coordination
- **Production schedules**: Comprehensive timeline management
- **Arrivals & Departures**: Travel coordination for visiting crew
- **Crew lists**: Complete team rosters
- **Runner assignments**: Transportation and logistics support
- **Payroll documentation**: Administrative processing support
### Real-Time Synchronization & Business Rules

**Change Propagation Logic**

When data is updated in one area, the system automatically:

1. **Identifies Dependencies**: Scans which documents reference the changed data
1. **Updates Documents**: Regenerates affected documents with new information
1. **Notifies Stakeholders**: Alerts relevant team members of changes
1. **Maintains Version History**: Preserves previous versions for reference
**Example Workflow**: When a shooting location changes:

- Location sheets update with new address/details
- Transport orders recalculate routes and timing
- Catering arrangements adjust for new venue requirements
- Team notifications sent about location change
**Data Integrity Rules**

- People must have minimum contact information before appearing in documents
- Events cannot overlap conflictingly for same resources

If you’re launching a new product or company, the name you choose may be the single most important decision you make. A great name creates a foundation of trust with consumers, gives meaning and voice to a new idea, and builds cumulative advantage over time. Names that are too descriptive and too comfortable won’t generate the interest or memorability that a new brand needs to succeed.

In my more than 40 years leading Lexicon Branding, we’ve created names like Swiffer, Sonos, BlackBerry, Azure, Impossible Foods, Vercel, Windsurf, and many more. In that time, I’ve seen too many teams treat naming as a low priority with marginal results. It’s one of the highest-stakes parts of building a brand, yet it’s too often delegated to junior staff or tackled in group brainstorming sessions.

The difference between a good-enough name and the right name is the difference between solid performance and breakthrough success. The right name is a competitive advantage that no one can take away from you.

Nobody knew Codeium until it became **Windsurf**.

People didn’t care about computer processors until Intel introduced **Pentium**.

No one loved mopping until Procter & Gamble created the **Swiffer**.

Nobody wanted to eat a Maraxi. But an **Impossible Burger**? Even meat lovers flocked to it.

### **Why names must work harder than ever**

AI and technologies like VR are reshaping how people discover, evaluate, and experience brands. We’ll see more innovation and new brands in the next five years than in the previous 20. This creates six key challenges:

1. **Unprecedented competition:** More players, more noise, more choice.
1. **Trademark clutter****:** Congestion across all 45 trademark classes. In the U.S., there are over 5,500,000 registered trademarks.
1. **Attention scarcity****:** Audiences are distracted and overwhelmed.
1. **Global digital commerce:** Names must work across languages, cultures, and platforms simultaneously.
1. **Institutional skepticism:** People have learned not to believe hype.
1. **Information overload:** A signal must be stronger to stand out.
For startups, the challenge is even greater. Your name must attract both investors and early adopters.

### **The three pillars of effective naming**

To address these challenges, focusing on three dimensions will increase your likelihood of creating a truly effective name. While we have been using these three pillars for many years at Lexicon, the first pillar, “Build for trust,” has increased in importance. The marketplace is moving so fast now that a new brand must gain momentum early or it will fail. Trust is a key factor in momentum.

### **1. ****Build for trust.**

The right name inspires both trust and imagination. Consider Microsoft’s Azure cloud services brand. The team at Microsoft considered calling it “Microsoft Cloud Services,” but there’s no news in such a straightforward name. When we presented this name, one senior Microsoft executive called it “a dumb idea.” Turns out, it wasn’t so dumb after all. It offered familiarity as a word while generating significant interest based on customer interviews. The sounds in Azure provide additional benefits: the “z” sound creates a strong signal, while the “zure” (like “sure”) creates a smooth experience.

### **2. ****Communicate an original idea. Never describe.**

Anyone can describe what a company does. For example, Infoseek is descriptive and one-dimensional. A name like that is boring and likely to have a thousand similar names swirling around in the competitive landscape. On the other hand, Google—an invented, surprising word—signals a new idea. In our research, we know we have a winner when customers tell us, “They’re not like the other guys.” TripActions is another example of a very descriptive name. As the company grew and developed an expense platform as well, TripActions no longer worked even descriptively. We created Navan, a palindrome that links to travel (“navigation”) but offers the originality that the company wanted to help them move into financial services—and the flexibility to grow into new industries. Since the rebrand in 2023, Navan revenues have grown from $150 million to over $500 million in 2025.

### **3. ****Be accessible.**

The human brain doesn’t like complexity—or remember it very well. Make sure your name is easy to process and contains familiar components. We used the simple and familiar geographic term “Outback” to create Subaru’s most successful brand to date.

### **Case study: Intel’s Pentium**

The story of Intel’s Pentium is a perfect example of how to structure a naming process to get an effective result.

Intel needed to differentiate its next-generation processor. Up to that point, chip manufacturers only used model numbers. While Intel’s 486 processor outperformed AMD’s 486, consumers perceived the two as identical. Can you blame them?

Our first criterion was to develop a name that would differentiate Intel’s processor from all others. Based on interviews with Intel executives, we agreed that the new name needed to capitalize on the success of the “Intel Inside” campaign. “Prochip” was an internal favorite at the time. But our research gave us clear creative direction: **develop a name that sounds and looks like an element inside the computer that is fundamental to performance****. **“Pentium” looked and sounded like familiar, science-based words such as “sodium” and “uranium,” using the “-ium” suffix for fluency. But while it was a familiar-seeming word, it was unexpected for the category—a strategic advantage that made it stick out and stick in people’s memory.

Here’s a key insight: Invented names like Pentium actually take less money to build into brands than existing words—despite a common myth to the contrary. Invented names signal “new and innovative” better than most other name types. Further, because they are unexpected rather than descriptive or suggestive names, they generate more attention. Humans are more interested in the new.

Research conducted by Lexicon in six markets provided data showing that “Pentium” delivered the magic Intel needed. Within months, consumers were asking for Pentium computers—to the chagrin of Dell, HP, and others.

### **The Lexicon process: beyond brainstorming**

Creating the right name requires more than one or two brainstorming sessions. Those brainstorming sessions—especially with four or more participants—can get bogged down by everyone’s need to be right, and the peer pressure to agree on a popular solution. As a result, they usually deliver marginal results. When we work with clients, we stick to key process principles:

**Set high standards, not narrow objectives.** Aim for fresh, energetic ideas, not just basic objectives like “support the product’s positioning” or “keep it under seven letters.”

We use a framework called the Diamond Framework to force clarity on business, marketing, and naming strategy. At the start of any project, we ask:

- What does winning look like?
- What do we have to win?
- What do we need to win?
- What do we need to say?
[Unsupported block type: image]

This creates alignment on the role of the name versus other brand elements like design and messaging. Here are the results of the exercise we did while working with P&G to develop the Swiffer brand name.

[Unsupported block type: image]

**Quantity breeds quality.** Developing a brand name is a treasure hunt. You need to explore, and then explore again. And you need to explore in places where you think there may be no chance of finding the name. Naming is hard work. We recommend generating at least 1,000 creative ideas before selecting a shortlist of 50 to 100 candidates. (We usually generate thousands.)

**Don’t underestimate the power of sound****.** Imagine the sound of your brand before you start naming. Should your name sound fast? Full? Reliable? Coca-Cola’s Dasani water brand exemplifies this. An invented name with the Latin word for health (“san”) in the middle, a “da” sound that delivers a crisp, clean experience, and an “i” sound that feels light and slim at the end.

### **Case study: Swiffer and the invention of a new category**

P&G had invented what they called a new mop, but it wasn’t really a mop. We started by interviewing 25 people about cleaning routines. Some enjoyed washing windows, others polishing furniture. No one liked mopping. One participant said, “It’s just moving dirt and grease from one place to another.” Another said, “Mopping is just not fun.”

We reframed the problem around fun, eliminating names like “Promop” or “EffiClean.” One small team explored toys, other exotic vacations, and other easy-to-use tools. Our linguists focused on the actions and sounds of cleaning—sweeping, wiping, washing. When we merged the work, “Swiffer” sat in the middle.

The best names don’t describe reality; they change it. Swiffer made mopping feel like a quick, joyful action. In research with our linguistic network and consumers, Swiffer was selected over 80% of the time as the new brand they would be most interested to try.

### **Case study: The story of Vercel**

When we started working with a company called Zeit, the team and technology were impressive. Using our Diamond Framework, we defined winning as being the most innovative and “fastest-moving company in the category.” Based on that, we agreed that a coined, inventive name was the right direction. We built matrices of naming components, including prefixes and suffixes that communicated accuracy, speed, and flow; word parts that spoke to the company’s talent and recruiting; and a set of Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit words that meant reliability and power. And using our proprietary sound-symbolism software, we identified fast-sounding letters.

Drawing from these components, we combined 55 prefixes and 102 suffixes and got about 60 interesting ideas—not solutions; not yet. We repeated the steps three times over two weeks. “Vercel” rose to the top with a sound that is alive and daring, six letters, familiar parts assembled in a unique way.

### **What not to do**

Here are a few things that we have learned not to do over four decades of naming:

- **Don’t think you’ll “know it when you see it.”** You won’t.
- **Don’t listen to anyone who dismisses bold ideas as “off-brand.”** Bold often becomes the brand.
- **Don’t rely on large brainstorming sessions** (they rarely work) or distant freelancers. Use small teams with real esprit de corps and grit.
- **Don’t play it safe.** Most approaches favor comfort over competitive edge, producing forgettable names that disappear. There is no power in comfort.
### **The bottom line**

The right name doesn’t just happen. It comes from a disciplined, creative process that pushes beyond comfort and challenges assumptions. It requires understanding your competitive landscape, your audience’s psychology, and the power of sound and meaning working together.

Do that work, and your name won’t just label what you built—it will change how people experience it. In today’s noisy, AI-driven landscape, that difference will make or break your success.
